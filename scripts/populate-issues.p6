    Module [$module](https://modules.perl6.org/dist/$module) is failing its tests and/or does not install.

    * Please close this issue only if the module **passes its tests and is installable**. One way to test it is to run `zef install MODULENAME`.
    * If you can **install the module without any problems**, label this ticket with `works for me` and close the issue.
    * If it **needs a native library**, put `native dependency` label, describe what you did to install it and ensure that same instructions are present in the README file of the module (otherwise submit a pull request). If everything is green you can close the issue.
    * If the **module is broken**, try to fix it and send a PR. Add `PR sent` label and close the issue.
    * If there is a **problem in one of the dependencies**, add `failing dependency` label and write a comment explaining the situation. Leave this ticket open and feel free to work on the corresponding ticket for the failing dependency.
    * It is a good idea to **assign yourself** to this ticket if you're working on it (to make sure two or more people are not working on the same ticket at the same time).

    If you can't self-assign, attach a label, or close the ticket, please let us know on [#perl6 channel on freenode](https://perl6.org/irc) or just leave a comment here. We will try to give you privileges as fast as possible.

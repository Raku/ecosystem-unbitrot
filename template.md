Module [｢MODULE｣](｢MODULE-URL｣) cannot be
installed, perhaps it has some failing tests.

* Tickets are opened/closed in this repo automatically (though not
  immediately).
* If you can **install the module without any problems**, add `works
  for me` label, leave a comment saying that it works for you and
  mention any details that you feel are important.
* If it **needs a native library**, put `native dependency` label,
  describe what you did to install it and ensure that same
  instructions are present in the README file of the module (otherwise
  submit a pull request).
* If the **module is broken**, try to fix it and send a PR. Add `PR
  sent` label.
* If there is a **problem in one of the dependencies**, add `failing
  dependency` label and write a comment explaining the situation. Feel
  free to work on the corresponding ticket for the failing dependency.
* It is a good idea to **assign yourself** to this ticket if you're
  working on it (to make sure two or more people are not working on
  the same ticket at the same time).
* **Once you are done**, [search for a next ticket](https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem-unbitrot/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3A%22PR+sent%22+-label%3A%22deprecated+module%22+-label%3A%22native+dependency%22).

If you can't self-assign yourself or attach a label, please let us
know on [#perl6 channel on freenode](https://perl6.org/irc) or just
leave a comment here. We will try to give you privileges as fast as
possible.
